# Vector Space Model

[Here](https://youtu.be/Ac7FGPe3o7U) you may find a demo of the running and final version of our software.

[Here](https://gitlab.com/reyesevan/VSM-search-engine) you may find the repository of our project. The program is optimized and it is structured with the dependency manager *Maven*, so import it with an IDE such as *IntelliJ IDEA* (with a `Java 8+ JDK`) should be enough to test it.

The structure of the source code upload to the portfolio is only for it to fulfill the specific requirements by the teacher, it will not work because *Maven* requires a project structure as follows:

```
src
| main
|	| kotlin
|	|	 com
|	|	|	group
|	|	|	|	artifactID
|	|	|	|	|	<packages>	
| resources
```
