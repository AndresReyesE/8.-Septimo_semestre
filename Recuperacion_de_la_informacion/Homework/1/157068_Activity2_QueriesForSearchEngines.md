## Exercise
*Think up and write down a small number of queries for a web search
engine. Make sure that the queries vary in length (they are not all one word).
Try to specify exactly what information you are looking for in some of the
queries. Run these queries on two commercial web search engines and
compare the top 10 results for each query by doing relevance judgments.*

### Questions
- *What is the precision of the results?*
- *What is the overlap between the results for the two search engines?*
- *Is one search engine clearly better than the other?*
  - *How much?*
  - *How do short queries performed compared to long queries?*

### Queries
- *Classical music for studying*
- *How to develop flexibility to do lotus position for beginners*
- *Compton window manager*

### Search engines
- [***Google***][google]
- [***Ecosia***][ecosia]

## Results

### Query: Classical music for studying

**Information need:** I'm trying to find an executable option (application/playlist) for obtain a potentially unlimited stream of classical music to help myself to focus while studying or working and, if possible, an explanation about why that music helps me
- **Google precision:** 1.0
- **Ecosia precision:**	0.8
- **Overlap:** 0.5
- **Is one search engine clearly better than the other?**

	&ensp;&ensp;I would not say that at least for this query. Although all the Google results may interest me, none of them actually explains why that music is going to help me improve my concentration, whereas some in Ecosia did, unfortunately, this last one showed me one ad and one application that doesn't work in my country, so those were not relevant to me.

### Query: How to develop flexibility to do lotus position for beginners

**Information need:** I'm trying to obtain a tutorial, a set of exercises or tips from a reliable source to get into lotus (or half lotus) position 
- **Google precision:** 1.0
- **Ecosia precision:**	1.0
- **Overlap:** 0.2
- **Is one search engine clearly better than the other?** 

    &ensp;&ensp;Google appears to be a much more mature search engine, it is able to even look into the videos it suggest to only limit its answer to a fraction of the video where it explicitly says the answer, whereas Ecosia shows the same video, but the link only

![Google result][googleResult]  
First result of Google to the second query
![Ecosia result][ecosiaResult]  
First result of Ecosia to the second query


### Query: Compton window manager

**Information need:** With this short query I am trying to get information about what compton is, how to install it, use it and/or taking advantage of it
- **Google precision:** 0.4
- **Ecosia precision:**	0.5
- **Overlap:** 0.4
- **Is one search engine clearly better than the other?**

	&ensp;&ensp;For this query, Ecosia returned better results than Google, since the latter asumed that my Desktop Environment for Linux is XCFE rather than KDE, whereas Ecosia showed results more general that was exactly what this time I was searching for.

## Overall

**• Is one engine clearly better than the other?** 
Not better, but clearly Google has been in the market for much longer than Ecosia. Google shows results more concise and usually precise, but it is important to consider that the company owns a lot of previous data about the user and is able to use it in order to obtain results more user-oriented, the downside about Google is that it gives its own suite of applications a lot more importance than the opposition, reason why the 100 % of the results in the first query were only YouTube's videos. Ecosia on the other hand offers more general results and ocassionally shows several ads, however, the goal of the search engine itself is enough revenue to not consider that last fact as a downside, especially if it is used for ecological reasons mainly. The aim of both engines is different and so is their set of results, the important part is to evaluate which one offers the most for the user in question.
   ◇ How do short queries performed compared to long queries?
	Short queries returned less than 100 % of precision in its results, while long searches allowed the search engines to return results that would be more likely to be relevant for the user because they allowed them to narrow better the results
